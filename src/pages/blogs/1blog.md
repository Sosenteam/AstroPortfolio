# 1st Blog

This is the first blog!

## Start of the class:

The start of the class was nice and chill for me, as I spent the first few days setting up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on my laptop. I also got connected to the sandbox server. Later in the week, I started to research various static site options to host this very blog!

## Static Site:

After some research, I settled on using the Astro framework because of it's lighting fast compile time and default markdown support (that's what these blogs are written in).  I first setup my basic pages, then created a static header bar component and a custom layout so I could apply CSS universally. I setup the blogs page to automatically import and list all the markdown pages, including adding title and description.

In my own time, I messed around with CSS for a while, so the site could look diffrent from default uncolored HTML.
